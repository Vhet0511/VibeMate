# VibeMate
This MERN app enables real-life socializing through real-time meetups, vibe-based matching, and city communities. React handles UI and swipes, while Node.js/Express manage APIs, auth, and WebSocket updates. MongoDB stores profiles, geolocation, matches, and chats. Geo-queries power location-based discovery.
